### Notes
I had a hard time with this. At first I was able to get the grid view going with movies, but then I changed the size of my uiimageview and ran it again and it gave this error 
cell.posterView.af.setImage(withURL: posterUrl!) Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while implicitly unwrapping an Optional value: file flixs/MovieGridViewController.swift, line 59

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-- while builiding, I kept forgetting to connect the viewController to the view so when I would run my app, the screen would be empty or the rows would have no data, thus causing me to start over because I didn't know where I went wrong lol.
